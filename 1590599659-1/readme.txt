The source code found here is meant to accompany the book Pro LINQ Object Relational Mapping with C# 2008.
This package of source code only includes the projects for Chapter 8 through Chapter 12.  The reason is that
there is enough in the text to get you going on the first 8 chapters; however if you are feeling really lazy drop me an email (vijay@mehtasolutions.com) and I will send you the rest of the code.  Also, important to note that the source code found here is not meant to be a starting point not an ending point, and is meant to be used with the book Pro LINQ Object Relational Mapping with C# 2008
